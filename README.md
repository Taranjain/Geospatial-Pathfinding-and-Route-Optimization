# Project Folder Usage Guide

This folder contains multiple projects. Below is a brief explanation on how to use each of them.
## Project 1: Star link Intersatellite Transmission Pathfinding Using A* Algorithm and TLE Data

demonstrates a robust approach to satellite pathfinding for Star link intersatellite transmission using TLE data, ECEF conversion, and the A* algorithm. 


### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashishbongu/Oops-Project.git 
2. Navigate to the project folder using:<br>

**COMMAND:  cd "D:/oops_project/A-star ALGORITHM"**

Inside the project folder, you'll find the src folder with the Java code and other necessary files.<br>
The dataset containing the geographical information is located outside the src folder, in the root project directory.<br>

3. Compile the Java file:

**COMMAND: javac main.java**

## Project 2: Nearest BRTS Station Finder

This project helps you find the nearest Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) station using geographical data.
