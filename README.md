# Project Folder Usage Guide

This folder contains multiple projects. Below is a brief explanation on how to use each of them.

## Project 2: Nearest BRTS Station Finder

This project helps you find the nearest Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) station using geographical data.

### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashishbongu/Oops-Project.git 
2. Navigate to the project folder using:<br>

**COMMAND:  cd "D:/oops_project/HAVERSINE ALGORITHM"**

Inside the project folder, you'll find the src folder with the Java code and other necessary files.<br>
The dataset containing the geographical information is located outside the src folder, in the root project directory.<br>

D:/oops_project/<br>
├── HAVERSINE ALGORITHM/<br>
│   ├── src/<br>
│   │   └── [BusStationGraph.java](https://github.com/ashishbongu/Oops-Project/blob/master/HAVERSINE%20ALGORITHM/src/BusStationGraph.java)<br>
│   ├── station.txt<br>
│   └── (other project files)<br><br>

3. Compile the Java file:

**COMMAND: javac BusStationGraph.java**
